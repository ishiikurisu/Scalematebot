# Scalematebot

An implementation of [Scalemate](https://github.com/ishiikurisu/scalemate) for Telegram. The idea of this Bot is to

1. Display an example of another implementation of the Scalemate Test engine.
2. Enable the use of Scalemate in other environments other than a desktop Windows machine.

Since it uses the same class for data access as the original ScalemateForms, it can be use in the same place as the old executable, just requiring a few more DLLs.
